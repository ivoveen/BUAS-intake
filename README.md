# My buas intake project: Win-Ball

For the buas intake everyone had to create a game using C++ and the template provided. 
For this intake there was also a theme every year to make sure people couldn't use a game they had already been working on.
The theme for this year was **bounce**.

So I ended up creating a small pinball machine game:

This was my biggest C++ project yet, having started learning C++ only a few months prior to prepare for the intake.
The best feature of my project was that I was completely calculating the collisions. 
Meaning it had a sort of continous collision detection system. 
I had made this system working out all the vector math myself so it is by no means a good way of doing it. 
But in the end the project was playable and somewhat impressive for someone with no prior experience.
So I got invited for an interview. I later heard I passed this interview as well and I was accepted as a new student at the Breda University of Applied Sciences.


### The game itself
In the game you can launch the ball with the up arrow key which then shoots it through a little tunnel and drops it into the pinball machine.
Then the player can use the left and right arrow keys to move the flippers and to try and keep the ball in the game. 
Every time the flipper hits the ball the player is awarded a point. 
Hitting a green wall awards a larger sum of points depending on how difficult it was to hit. 

The player had three four attempts at the game indicated by the hearts at the bottom of the screen.
Sometimes the ball glitches through the walls and falls off the map. This shows the limits of my system. 
The code itself is by no means pretty and looking back at this project 2 years later there is a lot I would do differently.
Nevertheless, this project was a good stepping stone in my journey to become a better programmer.
